We are a stand-alone specialty center (our emergencies are seen in a separate building just across the parking lot), and we are in the process of expanding into a larger space to give our existing services more room and to welcome new colleagues (that’s you!). Our full-time specialties include surgery, internal medicine, oncology, integrative medicine, physical therapy, behavior, and theriogenology. We also have a part time cardiologist four mornings a week.  We are located in Huntington, NY, which is a wonderful town on the North Shore of Long Island. Yes, everyone claims that their town is amazing, but in our case, it’s really true! The town itself is small enough for you to feel like a part of the community, but large enough to have a thriving downtown with diverse restaurants and an active nightlife, including the Paramount Theater, a world-renowned club venue that hosts many well-known live bands and comedians. We are just minutes away from beautiful beaches and state parks in the surrounding villages. If you travel one hour west, you find yourself in New York City, and if you travel one hour east, you can enjoy the luxury of the Hamptons (on the South Fork) or experience rural quietude on the North Fork, surrounded by farm stands, wineries, and delicious homemade pies (you have to try the grape pie…).  We are all seeing the effects of burnout in our profession, which has led to many discussions of work-life balance. This has become a bit of a buzzword these days, seen on every job listing as a selling point. For us, this is truly a concern, however, so we concentrate on giving our patients, clients, and staff the best care possible. When concerns arise, we will listen to you as an individual and work to achieve a fair and sustainable solution. We have a collegial and collaborative work environment, and everyone is very approachable, so there is always someone around and willing to lend a hand or an ear.  It's really nice to have an idea of compensation when reading through these job listings, so here you go!  We are offering a salary of $200,000-$250,0000 plus production and a sign-on bonus.  Other benefits include four weeks of PTO plus CE time, health, dental, and vision insurance, uniform stipend, CE allowance, 401K match, liability insurance, and coverage of your NY and DEA licenses. If there are other benefits that you have in mind, please ask. We can’t accommodate everything, of course, but we’re always open to discussion!  You would have a 4-day work week and reasonable control over how your schedule is set up, and we do not have scheduled on-call hours. We are also dedicated to giving you the staff you need to maximize efficiency. If you have a unique situation or want to discuss options not covered here, always feel free to reach out and let us know what you are looking for. If it works for all of us, we can be flexible.

8500849695,"Senior Platform Software Architect Overview  About DISCO  DISCO provides a cloud-native, artificial intelligence-powered legal solution that simplifies e-discovery, legal document review, and case management for enterprises, law firms, legal services providers, and governments. Our scalable, integrated solution enables legal departments to easily collect, process, and review enterprise data that is relevant or potentially relevant to legal matters.  Are you ready to help us fulfill our mission to use technology to strengthen the rule of law? Join us!  Your Impact:  As a Senior Back-end Engineer, you will build high-quality software delivering feature sets that delight customers while driving the architecture of one or more Subsystems towards our aspirational goal of everything ‘well-crafted’. A great candidate can deliver real customer value while pursuing ‘high marks’ on these Architecture Quality Attributes: Availability, Scalability, Interoperability, Modifiability, Performance, Security, Testability.  What You’ll Do:  — Be part of an autonomous, cross-functional team designing, building and operating strategic, user-focused feature sets — Creating services that enable users to build complex search queries that remain responsive while spanning terabytes of data. — Building containerized web application services in Python that empower users to work on large data sets in a responsive manner.  Who You Are:  — Possess 5+ years of back-end development experience for large scale web applications. — Be able to design and communicate external and internal architectural perspectives of well-encapsulated systems (e.g. Service Oriented Architecture, Docker-based Services, micro-services). — Prior experience with building and operating distributed web application systems while embracing the discipline of Site Reliability Engineering. — Strong skills in API and Data Model Design and Implementation including how to scale out, make highly available, and map to storage systems. — Ability to design and implement a layered application architecture that can be easily changed to accommodate evolving business requirements.  Even Better If:  — You have an understanding of how to design and develop from a Security Perspective. — You have experience designing and operating software in a Cloud Provider such as AWS, Azure, or GCP. — You have experience with some amount of cloud-based data storage technologies such as; Relational Databases, NoSql Stores, data caches, etc. — You have used Feature or Release Toggles as a code branching strategy. — You have experience selecting and extending 3rd party components (commercial or open-source) that provide operational leverage. — You have experience with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with an emphasis on a well-maintained testing pyramid.  Perks of DISCO Open, inclusive, and fun environment Benefits, including medical, dental and vision insurance, as well as 401(k) Competitive salary plus RSUs Flexible PTO Opportunity to be a part of a company that is revolutionizing the legal industry Growth opportunities throughout the company  DISCO’s Technology Stack:  Cloud Provider: AWS — EC2, Lambda, Aurora MySQL, Redshift, DynamoDB, ECS, SQS, SNS, Kinesis, S3, CloudFront, CloudFormation, SageMaker, KMS, CodePipeline, etc. DSL-based Search: multiple large scale Elasticsearch Clusters searched using our Disco Query Language (DQL) Event Bus: Kafka and Schema Registry 3rd Party Vendors: Redis, Auth0 for Cloud Identity Federation (SSO, SAML, etc) AI: MinHash, Word2Vec, Convolution Neural Nets, Algorithmia (Lambda with GPUs) for training, PyTorch, Recurrent Neural Networks, Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Topic Modeling, etc. CI/CD: Terraform, Docker (via ECS), Jenkins, CodeDeploy, GitHub, Artifactory, Consul for App Config, Service Discovery, Shared Secrets Visibility: ELK Stack for logging, Data Dog, New Relic, Sentry.io Programming Languages: Python / Flask, Java/Kotlin, C#/.NET, JavaScript/React Transport Mechanisms: Protobuf, Avro, HTTP Rest/JSON  Why Join DISCO’s Product Delivery Team  We intend to build a multi-billion dollar business and think you should come along for the ride because:  We were the first movers to a cloud-based platform that has caused mass disruption within our market. Our CEO is a true market visionary. He graduated with a computer science degree at the age of 15 and followed with a JD from Harvard Law School at the age of 19. His unparalleled insights into the fundamental issues in legal and the potential of technology and artificial intelligence to change our market at its core provide the guiding light for DISCO’s long-term strategy. We believe that product delivery professionals including product managers, product designers and engineers differ from one another by at least a factor of 10. At DISCO, we only hire the top 1%, pay them well, and with equity, everyone has effectively been getting a raise each and every day. Given our product first mindset, product professionals are very much stars of the show. Our logo, the circle and square, represents the best lawyers and the best product professionals in the world. We measure product delivery velocity by dollars of revenue per line of code, vs simply lines of code. This drives a very thoughtful and deliberate product design and development process that ensures we’re going to make money when we ship products. We hire many more product managers and designers per engineer than most companies to ensure that our engineers have a disambiguated product intent when they are building. As a rule, we don’t commit to external product delivery dates as we believe that unnecessarily constrains our creativity from both a product and technology point of view. At DISCO respect isn’t earned at DISCO it is assumed. Good humans inherently treat everyone respectfully. This is a very important concept at DISCO. Given the high caliber of talent, the cutting-edge cloud-based technology stack, and thoughtful and novel product and design approach, you’ll find yourself learning at a rate you’ve not likely experienced in your career. Given that we only hire professionals that are passionate about their craft, you’ll truly enjoy building a great software product and get in the best “career shape” of your life. Over the next 4 years, we’ll be growing our product delivery organization. There will be incredible growth opportunities along the way. We use the “2 Pizza Team” organization design where small autonomous teams own a piece of a product or platform and ship software at rates comparable to a very lean and scrappy startup. We achieve consistency across these teams in the areas of design, product-wide use cases and technical concerns through a strategically focused set of overlay functions. Finally, while we’re an incredibly fast-growing organization, as a rule, we do not work crazy long hours. We believe in continuous product delivery, continuous product planning and design, continuous regular sleep schedules, continuous regular vacation, and continuous fun if you’re passionate about your craft. If you want to win while getting better than you’ve ever been, come to DISCO.","Senior Platform Software Architect Overview About DISCO DISCO provides a cloud-native, artificial intelligence-powered legal solution that simplifies e-discovery, legal document review, and case management for enterprises, law firms, legal services providers, and governments."

8871079134,"USFS Postdoctoral Research Fellowship: Modeling Hydrological Outcomes of Stream and Valley-floor Restoration Organization U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Reference Code USDA-USFS-PNWRS-2023-0399 How to Apply  Connect with ORISE...on the GO! Download the new ORISE GO mobile app in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store to help you stay engaged, connected, and informed during your ORISE experience and beyond!  A complete application package consists of:  An application Transcript(s) – For this opportunity, an unofficial transcript or copy of the student academic records printed by the applicant or by academic advisors from internal institution systems may be submitted. Selected candidate must provide proof of completion of the degree before the appointment can start. A current resume/CV Two educational or professional recommendations. At least one recommendation must be submitted in order for the mentor to view your application.  All documents must be in English or include an official English translation.  Description  *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis, and this opportunity will remain open until filled.  USFS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS), Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNW) located in Corvallis, Oregon. This appointment will be based out of the PNW Research Station’s office located in Corvallis, Oregon (but a request to be located in La Grande, Oregon would be considered). Up to 8 weeks per year may be spent in the field, at the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range near La Grande, Oregon where the PNW Research Station maintains a small field station. The USFS has flexible schedules and may allow opportunities to participate remotely. There will be opportunities to attend regional and national meetings, conferences and workshops.  Research Project: The USFS PNWRS is seeking a Postdoctoral Fellow (Post-Doc) with quantitative experience in hydrology – especially development of reach- to watershed-scale water budgets and groundwater flow modeling. The Post-Doc will be engaged in a highly collaborative multi-agency monitoring and analysis effort to determine the effects of watershed-scale restoration project in Meadow Creek, a tributary of the Grande Ronde River in NE Oregon. A critical focal question for this project is: Does restoration measurably augment late-summer stream flow? Answering this question will require use of groundwater flow models to simulate pre- and post-restoration flows and storage of shallow groundwater in the floodplains of the restored stream and development of a reach-scale water budget that accounts for all fluxes into, and out of, the reach.  The opportunity described here is part of a larger project designed to evaluate multiple facets of a multi-million-dollar valley-floor restoration project located in the upper Grande Rhonde River. Specific topics being addressed include hydrology, stream temperature, and aquatic ecology, along with studies of upland thinning patterns on snow deposition and melt. Data collected over the last several decades in the Meadow Creek watershed provide a foundation to characterize pre-restoration conditions and will provide a framework from which to conceptualize outcomes of future floodplain and process-based restoration actions. The project will include both analysis of existing datasets as well as new field monitoring, data collection, modeling, and synthesis. The overall goal of the project is to evaluate whole system response to previous restoration and management actions as well as providing a platform to understand the effects of ongoing and novel floodplain restoration. Improved understanding of stream and groundwater hydrology are a critical foundation for the overall project.

The nature of the shipboard positions requires able-bodied personnel who can endure working long hours and being away from shore for extended periods of time. Employees must have the ability to perform required duties with or without reasonable accommodation.  ROUTES AND CHANGE PORTS AMHS operates in two distinctive routes. The Southeast (SE) route serves the communities between Bellingham, WA and Skagway, AK. The majority of AMHS vessels operate on this route. The other, more remote route is the Southwest (SW), which includes the communities between Cordova and the Aleutian Chain. The Change Ports (crew change locations) for each route is listed below;  Southeast (SE): Ketchikan, Juneau Southwest (SW): Homer, Valdez  Please note: This position requires employees report to designated change ports in Alaska for their work assignments. Employees are responsible for their own travel expenses between their physical residence and their designated change port. Commuting between home in Lower 48 and change ports in Alaska is not a financially viable option for most crew.  SCHEDULE & ASSIGNMENTS AMHS vessels operate in a 24/7 work environment with variable crewing schedule. In general, periodic crew assignments are based on a 2 Weeks-On and 2 Weeks-Off rotation with some exceptions. On vessels operating in Southwest route, your assignment duration will depend on the lengths of the absence of the crew member you relieve. Once onboard, the daily schedule during each assignment may vary from 8 hours to 12 hours depending on the route/vessel. Vessel supervisor set work the schedule upon signing on to the vessel that may include split shifts. Crew members may be asked to fill in a higher paying position after the crew change if a vacancy occurs (temporary upgrades). Crew lists are posted periodically by AMHS dispatch office which handles all crew scheduling related matters. Please note: Work assignments are scheduled by the Dispatch desk, based on the fluctuating operational needs and in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreements. Seniority plays a major role on how work is assigned.  WORKING ONBOARD This is a fast-paced and dynamic work environment with a diverse workforce. Room & board is provided while on assignment - on select vessels. Crew stays in shared quarters and meals are provided at the crew and/or officers mess. On some vessels the crew returns to home port each night before heading out the next day (Day Boats). Regardless of the various room and board situations, AMHS is a Drug and Alcohol-Free workplace and has a strictly enforced Drug & Alcohol Policy. Please note: All employees stationed onboard the vessels, regardless of their status, including new hires residing onboard through the housing assistance incentive, are subject to all DOT&PF and AMHS policies. There is no tolerance for Drug and Alcohol policy violations.  Pay Scale AMHS offers a competitive pay based on operating route and residency.

Company Overview  Battelle manages and operates the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) program, which is solely funded by the National Science Foundation. A 30+ year project dedicated to understanding how changes in climate, land use and invasive species impact ecology, the observatory’s scientists and engineers are collecting a comprehensive range of ecological data on a continental scale across 20 eco-climatic domains representing US ecosystems. Our teams use cutting-edge technology, including an airborne observation platform that captures images of regional landscapes and vegetation; mobile, relocatable, and fixed data collection sites with automated ground sensors to monitor soil and atmosphere; and trained field crews who observe and sample populations of diverse organisms and collect soil and water data. Once structures are completed, a leading-edge cyberinfrastructure will calibrate, store and publish this information. The Observatory includes more than 500+ personnel and is the first of its kind designed to detect and enable forecasting of ecological change at continental scales.  Job Summary  We are currently seeking a Field Ecologist II-General. This position is in Tuscaloosa, AL.

9333382110,"Roll-Off Driver - CDL (B) ($2500.00 S/O Bonus) ABOUT THE COMPANY  Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.  In 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills.  Although we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.  Our customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose Republic Services because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.  Our company values guide our daily actions:  Safe: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities. Committed to Serve: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations. Environmentally Responsible: We take action to improve our environment. Driven: We deliver results in the right way. Human-Centered: We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.  We are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.  STRATEGY  Republic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.  We focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.  With our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.  Recycling and Waste  We continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.  Environmental Solutions  Our comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.  SUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION  Republic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.  The Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.  We continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.

If you answer yes, yes, yes, and yes, keep reading - we’ve got something exciting for you.  Who we are Hi, we’re Upgrow. We are a digital marketing agency focused on growth through Paid Media, SEO, and conversion-focused design and copywriting.  Our team is primarily remote but has shared office space with teammates in San Francisco and San Diego. This is a hybrid role that requires in-office attendance in San Diego 3x per week.  We focus mainly on B2B lead generation, driving marketing qualified leads and ultimately sales for our clients to help their business bottom line. Our mission is to accelerate growth for remarkable brands – we work with businesses focused on high growth and ready to scale.  Here’s how you and Upgrow can get aligned based on our core values: We Have Relentless Ownership You are the person everyone can count on. You show up, are prepared, and smash it every. single. time. You ask for pointed help when you need it and find solutions without fail. You are results-driven, naturally competitive, and thrive on the challenge to achieve performance results for our clients as well as our internal company goals This means you set appropriate expectations with clients and internally on meeting deadlines and ensure that quality work is delivered You understand and take ownership of the outcomes and can work collaboratively with the team in achieving that without making excuses or trying to sandbag We Have Demanding Expectations You take pride in your craft and strive for excellence in the quality of the work produced You can lead and set the standard of excellence for the team to ensure that our clients are impressed and overjoyed by the quality of work we do and produce You are excitedly open to expanding your skills and responsibilities beyond your core job function. We Advance Our Skills through Learning & Evolve with the Industry You are never comfortable; you are always looking for ways to improve. You are naturally curious and enjoy learning about the latest shifts in advertising trends/evolutions, technology advancements, privacy changes and product developments. You see the value in running training/mentoring, introducing/improving processes and knowledge-sharing We Win Together You actively seek out to make yourself available to help, share knowledge, and support your teammates You are a joy to work with through open/clear communication and following the company’s systems/processes You celebrate and take joy not just in your own success, but the success of others We’re a small and mighty team that’s fast-growing (we’ve been Inc 5000 honoree 2X now) and looking to grow into a world-class leading agency, driving amazing results as marketers.  Many job descriptions are quick and generic, leaving you with lots of questions. This is meant to be a comprehensive look at the role, who it’s a good fit for, and how we operate as a company. With that disclaimer, you officially can’t get mad that it’s long!  Our application and hiring process is more in-depth than usual, and it is because we want to make sure you’re the right fit for us to ensure you’re set up for success here at Upgrow. So please take time to read and go through our hiring processes so you know what to expect.  If who we are sounds like a dream place to be, then you’ve come to the right place! Life at Upgrow We are partially hybrid in-office and remote, spread across multiple US time zones. This means asynchronous communication is crucial to maximize productivity and efficiency.  We DO: - Build awesome relationships based on trust with clients and internal teams - Superior work quality (strategy presentations, media planning/forecasting, planning campaign structures that an architect would be impressed) - KPI results (driving qualified leads and sales) - Focus on the 80/20 rule to execute on things that matter  We AVOID: - Making reports and presentations that no one uses - Doing things that don't move the needle - Repeatedly doing tasks that could be automated - Anything unproductive!  We are highly collaborative and very organized, where we communicate internally primarily on Slack/Zoom, and use project management tools like ClickUp, Basecamp, and Confluence to ensure projects/tasks are planned out and delivered on time.  Every week we have company-wide meetings to sync together and get company-level updates (e.g., sales, ops, people), and we have short 15-minute daily team huddles to ensure everyone is aligned and not blocked.  For fun, we run monthly virtual happy hours, have in-person lunches (where possible), and have a dedicated Slack channel for non-work chatter so you can share your favorite emojis/GIFs or photos from your weekend or vacation!  What will you do? As an Senior Paid Media Manager, you will be the main point of contact for 4-6 client accounts, handling account management, strategy, and campaigns (at least Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads). After studying each client and their industry, you'll develop a strategy to achieve their performance goals, not just leads but, more importantly, sales/opportunities.  You'll drive paid media strategy across single or multiple channels, build media plans, executing on campaign builds (and everything that goes with it), with the support of a Paid Media Specialist. You will also provide reporting and project updates to clients in recurring meetings and handle client communications.  Must Haves: Results driven - you have a track record of achieving results, and if you’re not getting results, you have an insatiable appetite to identify opportunities, get client buy-in and execute. You know how to identify where the opportunities are in order to move the needle and not be focused on just checking off a checklist (although those are important) Great communication skills - you are able to distill complex Paid Media concepts into easy-to-understand terms for clients (who may not be as savvy) to understand, get buy-in, and appreciate the value of what we’re doing Highly organized and process driven - you’re able to use project management tools to break out that tasks need to be done by when and by who, stay on top of multiple projects, and ensure client delivery is met Analytical & Data-driven - you don’t just make guesses as to why metrics go up or down but are comfortable diving deep and analyzing data in order to draw actionable insights and conclusions. You dream in pivot tables and when you're looking at numbers, you can tell a story on what's going on. Specialized Paid Media Experience - you have a proven track record of Paid Media achievements (especially Google Ads and/or LinkedIn Ads), with typically 5+ years of experience creating strategy, reporting to stakeholders, and executing implementation. Competitive and Confident - you are naturally a high achiever and feel sick in the stomach on delivering sub-par work. You get competitive when you get outranked and find ways to win. Nice To Have: Experience in B2B SaaS/Enterprise technology Experience in other ad platforms (e.g. Meta Ads, Reddit Ads, Programmatic) Advanced knowledge of Google Tag Manager (using regex, datalayer, javascript) Web development skills (using HTML/CSS, Javascript) These are our Paid Media tech stack: Analytics: GA4, Google Tag Manager Business Intelligence: Looker Studio, Supermetrics AI: ChatGPT Our work hours are typically your standard 40/wk. Core working hours are 8:30am to 5:30pm in your time zone (except EST which is 9am to 6pm). This means during work hours, you are in a focused environment where you are dedicating your time and attention to Upgrow with a good internet connection and good work space. Show me the money Alright, let’s get to the point of why your time isn’t free but valuable. Here’s what we’re offering in exchange for your services: Competitive base annual salary - ranging from $80,000 - $90,000 (for hybrid in San Diego) High bonus potential! Annual company profit sharing, performance incentives and case study bonuses (can add 20%+ to your salary if you’re a high performer!) Paid health, dental, and vision Life and disability insurance Unlimited PTO, plus 10 company holidays Sweet Company swag that will quickly elevate your social status. Is this a good fit for me? Obviously, we're biased, but here is our honest (as can be) assessment of the pros/cons of working at Upgrow — in this role. Benefits to you and your career Have an impact Because we’re a small company, every single person matters in our team. You’re not some cog in a giant machine and the work that you do matters. We need people who have ideas to bring to the table and want to take action. This is your opportunity to step up to the plate and do things your way - this is the role in your career that you'll look back on fondly and know you created something truly special and innovative. Work with genuinely good people Did we mention we want to get sh*t done with no bullsh*t? We have no room for internal politics and egos – we desire to see our clients and our team succeed without the unnecessary hindrances Huge career upside Because we are small and nimble, we’re able to identify high performers and move them quickly into larger roles and responsibilities vs. traditional conventions. We have performance incentives in place to reward high achievers Hybrid setup (San Diego) You're excited about coming into the office, seeing your coworkers and looking forward to collaborating with each other. Maybe grab lunch or a beer (or two)! We offer the flexibility of remote work plus the advantage of in-person work to foster enhanced collaboration, engagement and connectedness. Who would NOT want to take this role A good match for any role requires a great fit between team members and the company. There are amazing people who aren’t in the right time/space in their careers to thrive and appreciate every role. . . and that’s totally ok! Just trying to keep it real here. It might not be a good fit for you, IF: You want to be told exactly what to do While we have some processes documented and our team are not newbies, we need you to bring ideas to the table and make things better. That doesn't mean you're on your own or starting from 0, but we do want you to drive with ownership and accountability. So if you're looking for more of a straightforward execution role, this is not it. You’re looking for a paycheck, not a career If you’re looking for a simple 9-5 job to collect a paycheck, then this isn’t a place. We need people who are passionate about what they do, and have strong ownership and accountability. This means sometimes you’re working longer hours in order to get the job done and ensuring work produced is to a high quality/standard. You’re looking for chill, slow and easy Being in a small agency, we pride ourselves in our ability to be nimble and move quickly for our clients. This sometimes means pivoting and executing quickly, without having all the information in front of you. You need to have a sense of urgency, and not take your sweet time because you can’t handle the stress. You play not to lose We’re looking for people who want to play to win vs. not to lose. This means you’re looking for reasons and excuses on why you can’t achieve your goals vs. figuring out what is needed in order for you to achieve your goals. You want a freelance-style work schedule If your schedule requires high flexibility or you prefer working exclusively in the middle of the night, then this probably isn't your gig. If you are backpacking across Europe with sometimes spotty wifi then you're also going to have a hard time. You hate going to the office and seeing people You b*tch and whine about commuting to work, and prefer staying at home playing Fortnite or watching Netflix in between. Did we mention this was a hybrid in-office role?

Guided by Milton's core values of self-confidence, shared exchange of ideas, and deep respect for diversity, the Chief Advancement Officer will provide leadership and clear feedback to a dedicated team of approximately 20 professionals, overseeing all aspects of fundraising, advancement services, alumni relations, and parent relations activities and events. The Chief Advancement Officer will manage capital campaigns, major gift activities, and work closely with the Board of Trustees, particularly the Financial Sustainability Committee, to enhance major gift fundraising strategies. The Chief Advancement Officer will define the strategic direction for annual giving and alumni relations programs, setting communications strategy, managing a portfolio of high-value prospects, expanding planned giving opportunities, and fostering relationships with all constituents through various programs and special events. By aligning development and alumni relations efforts with Milton’s culture and commitment to preparing students to meet high expectations, the Chief Advancement Officer will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Milton Academy.  FROM THE HEAD OF SCHOOL  Thank you so much for your interest in joining Milton Academy!  Although my tenure as Milton’s new Head of School began a year ago, my relationship with Milton extends back nearly 40 years to my arrival as a new tenth grade boarding student in the fall of 1985. While much has changed at Milton in the intervening years, I know first-hand that the important things—the things that are quintessentially Milton—remain unchanged. Milton is an environment steeped in academic excellence and a community that is inclusive, compassionate, and driven to celebrate each student’s individual strengths, passions, and identity. This commitment to our mission is central to everything we do, in our classrooms and throughout all our operations.  During my first year as Head of School, I have had the opportunity to speak with many alumni, virtually all of whom credit Milton with their development as intellectuals and citizens of the world. For all of them, ""Dare to be true"" is not only our treasured motto, but also a calling to be bold and passionate, and to embrace and encourage these qualities in others. Milton has always sought to be a school that stands for something greater than itself.  Milton is uniquely structured to serve both day and boarding students, with an innovative and inspiring vision for contemporary independent education. We are celebrated for our breadth of educational offerings across three divisions (K-12), and our vibrant population of both domestic and international students in the Upper School. While we are an independent school in all of the best ways, we certainly embrace a larger public purpose.  The strength of our school is evident—we have competitive admissions, desirable post-secondary outcomes, enviable fundraising results, and a world-class faculty. We are so proud of what Milton is, but we also have big ambitions for what Milton can become. Our leadership team is excited about the possibilities that will come from our nascent strategic planning process. We are focused on exploring big, bold ideas for the school’s future.  The new Chief Advancement Officer will play a critical role in realizing our ambitions, both through the strategic planning process, and the emergent capital campaign. The team and I are looking forward to welcoming a new colleague who shares our commitment to not only finding joy in the daily life of the school, but also to ensuring that Milton’s vibrant intellectual energy will continue to prepare students for an increasingly complex world well into the future.  —Dr. Alexandra H. Callen ’88, Head of School  ABOUT MILTON ACADEMY  Dynamic, complex, and buzzing with intellectual excitement, Milton Academy encourages its K-12 students to explore their passions, discover new interests, and take risks in a supportive, academically rigorous environment. “Dare to be true,” the independent school’s treasured motto, is alive on Milton’s vibrant campus—located just south of Boston—where diverse and talented students from across the U.S. and around the world are nurtured in the development of their identities and encouraged to be themselves. One of very few schools in the U.S. to offer a K-12 academic experience that includes a boarding and day program in its upper grades, Milton strives to engage students in ambitious preparation for college and for life in an environment that stimulates intellectual and personal growth. Evolving and enduring, the school maintains the academic standards throughout its three divisions that have earned Milton its national and global acclaim, while continually adapting teaching and learning practices to ready students for the modern world. In the Lower School, students master the foundations of education and learn through creative learning and exploration. In the Middle School, they grow in independence and responsibility. In the Upper School, a vibrant mix of international and domestic students enrolled in highly selective boarding and day programs become young adults who learn with zeal and advocate for their communities. Milton students at all levels are met with age-appropriate challenges from teachers who take a holistic approach to their development. The school encourages students to approach problems and projects with curiosity and creativity.  Milton faculty and staff participate with enthusiasm in the life of the school beyond their roles as educators, serving in many other roles, such as advisors, coaches, directors, and dorm parents. Milton’s mission statement describes the school’s celebration of inclusion, community-building, and individual expression and development:  Milton Academy cultivates in its students a passion for learning and a respect for others. Embracing diversity and the pursuit of excellence, it creates a community in which individuals develop competence, confidence, and character. This active learning environment, in and out of the classroom, develops creative and critical thinkers, unafraid to express their ideas, prepared to seek meaningful lifetime success and to live by the motto, ""Dare to be true.”  In classrooms and labs, on stages and playing fields, as teammates and as leaders, Milton students stand out because of their desire to grow, achieve, and make a difference. The community values empathy, courage, and connection as students and adults engage with one another and in the world beyond campus. Graduates carry Milton’s spirit of excellence with them, becoming leaders and innovators in science, business, medicine, art, government, social justice, entertainment, academia, and technology.  A Milton education is experiential and immersive—one that encourages students to continue learning beyond the classroom and to grow as citizens of a global society. The school sits on 130 acres and its proximity to Boston’s resources and cultural opportunities extends learning beyond Milton’s campus.  Milton students have myriad opportunities to learn in the world. Community Engagement Programs and Partnerships have placed hundreds of students weekly in service sites across Greater Boston, where they have tutored public school students, helped English language learners, participated in sustainability efforts, and provided companionship for elders. Service trips on school vacations have taken students to Navajo Nation, New Orleans, and rural areas in the United States. The Modern Languages Department has offered exchange programs with students in France, China, and Spain; various Milton music groups have traveled internationally for performances, including to South Africa and Europe; and the school’s Outdoor Program offers activity-based trips throughout New England. Additionally, Juniors may apply for semester programs (including at the Mountain School—a working farm in Vershire, Vermont owned by Milton Academy that accepts students from all over the U.S.).  DARE TO BE TRUE  Adopted in 1898, Milton Academy's motto resounds in the minds and hearts of today’s students and graduates. Often cited by both faculty and students as the litmus test for word or action, “Dare to be true” not only states a core value, but it also describes Milton’s culture. Milton believes that a vital and effective community is built on individuals’ self-confidence and shared exchange of ideas. Grounded in values, deeply respectful of diversity, and fully aware of the issues of their time, Milton students graduate fully prepared to continue working to meet their own high expectations in the many venues which follow.  MILTON ACADEMY'S COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND JUSTICE  Milton maintains a school-wide commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) and aspires to create a healthy, anti-racist, and inclusive culture for its students, faculty, and staff. The school recognizes that growing and learning among people who share widely divergent life stories— and appreciating their backgrounds and cultures—is an invaluable component of a true education. The school believes that each of us brings a unique and important dimension to our shared experience, and that drives relationships at Milton.  Nearly 50 percent of Upper School students identify as students of color with similar percentages in the Lower and Middle School programs. Milton strives to support students in their diverse range of identities, and regularly evaluates its culture and practices to ensure a welcoming school for all. Milton offers dozens of clubs and affinity spaces for students, which include groups that celebrate and provide bonding opportunities around culture and identity.

LEADERSHIP  Alexandra H. Callen '88 Head of School A lifelong educator deeply committed to innovation and student success, Dr. Alexandra “Alixe” Callen became Milton Academy’s 13th Head of School in 2023. Dr. Callen, a member of Milton’s Class of 1988, has extensive teaching and leadership experience in both public and independent schools.  Milton received its reaccreditation in 2023, and Dr. Callen is poised to embark on the next phase of the school’s strategic planning. A coalition builder and thoughtful communicator, she has empowered a talented Leadership Team to oversee Milton’s three academic divisions and all of the K–12 school’s educational, co-curricular, and operational functions. Keeping students at the center of each decision and initiative, she has built a sense of joyful community across the vibrant and diverse campus.  Prior to joining Milton, Dr. Callen was Head of School at St. George’s School in Middletown, Rhode Island, where she and her team undertook a full-scale effort to review and renew the school’s curriculum to support interdisciplinary and connected learning, prioritizing strong academics and reflecting the latest research in education. Tapping into the expertise of the school’s most veteran faculty, Dr. Callen energized pedagogical and professional development through dedicated programs for teaching and learning.  Her team launched the Beloved Community Initiative, a program focused on the history of St. George’s and the experiences of students across diverse identities. She also collaborated with the school’s advancement office to raise more than $20 million to support new capital projects.  Dr. Callen received her bachelor’s degree in American civilization from Brown University, a Master of Arts in teaching degree from Brown, a master’s degree in administration, planning, and social policy from Harvard University, and her doctorate from Harvard, where she was elected to the Harvard Educational Review. Prior to St. George’s, she was the Upper School Director at Lakeside School in Seattle, the Principal of Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in Acton, Massachusetts—a 2,000-student public school consistently rated among the best in the state—and Assistant Principal of Needham High School in Needham, Massachusetts.
